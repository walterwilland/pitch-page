            <div class="eight wide column"><p>Working in the field of visual communication design I’ve gained experience not only in the classroom, but also with clients in the local area. I’ve also gained a great deal of experience working with my classmates in team projects several times with many different students. These projects include logo design, brand idenity, web design, package design, form design, illustration, typography, and many other various elements of visual communication. I am comfortable expressing my work openly and building off of my designs through peer review and critiques. I am confident in my abilities as a designer. </p></div>
